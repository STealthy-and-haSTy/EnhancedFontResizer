EnhancedFontResizer
===================

This is a simple package for Sublime Text 4 builds 4153 and up that
allows you to alter the font zoom:

  - Globally, in the Preferences.sublime-settings file
  - Per window, in the settings key of the project data for the window
  - By syntax, by updating your Syntax Specific sublime-settings file
  - Per view, adjusting only the current tab

In addition, when the font size is reset, the size resets a known
default rather than just erasing the setting (and reverting you back
to the official Sublime default).


Quick Start
-----------

A new menu entry `Preferences > EnhancedFontResizer` contains the full
set of font adjustment commands for all of the various situations.

By default, ***NO KEY BINDINGS ARE ADDED***, but Sublime's default key
bindings will map to the global font manipulation options.

Under `Preferences > Package Settings > EnhancedFontResizer` are menu
entries for the keyboard and mouse mappings; the default files that
ship with the package have examples for all of the various font zoom
options; copy the ones you would like to use to your user preferences,
un-comment them, and adjust as desired.
